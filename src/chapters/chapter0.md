## Introduction

Welcome to Global Azure Bootcamp! All around the world user groups and communities want to learn about Azure and Cloud Computing! On April 22, 2017, all communities will come together once again in the fifth great Global Azure Bootcamp event! Each user group will organize their own one day deep dive class on Azure the way they see fit and how it works for their members.

To get started you'll need the following pre-requisites. Please take a few moments to ensure everything is installed and configured.

* Microsoft Windows PC
* [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com) 2015 or later
* [Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com) (trial is ok, and we'll sign you up in our first session)
* [Azure SDK for .NET](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/) installed (be sure to get the right one for your version of Visual Studio)
* [Storage Explorer](http://storageexplorer.com/) installed
* [Storage Emulator](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=717179&clcid=0x409) installed
* The [starter project](https://github.com/mikebranstein/GlobalAzureDay2017/tree/start) on Github

### What You're Building

Azure is big. Really big. Too big to talk about all things Azure in a single day. 

We've assembled an exciting workshop to introduce you to several Azure services that cloud developers should know about:
* [Web app](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/web/)
* [BLOB storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/)
* [Table storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/tables/)
* [Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/)
* [Cognitive Services](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services) API for [computer vision](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/computer-vision-api)
* [SignalR](https://www.asp.net/signalr) (yeah it's not a Azure service, but it is pretty cool)

In this workshop you'll learn how to use these Azure services to build a cloud-hosted single sign-on app that can manage your user profile. When you're finished, you will have built an app that allows you to upload profile pictures that pass through an AI content filter to ensure they're work appropriate. 

#### Key concepts and take aways
